# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System  

### *By Mowleen Armstrong*  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
The **Movie Recommendation System** is a machine learning-based application that suggests movies based on user preferences. Built with **Streamlit**, it allows users to choose a genre and set a minimum critic score for personalized recommendations. The system uses a **Random Forest Classifier** for accurate predictions.  

## ðŸ›  Features  
âœ… **User-Created Dataset**: Built using Microsoft Excel.  
âœ… **Genre-Based Recommendations**: Users select a genre, and the system suggests relevant movies.  
âœ… **Critic Score Filtering**: Users can set a minimum critic score to refine recommendations.  
âœ… **Machine Learning Model**: Uses a **Random Forest Classifier** and **OneHotEncoder**.  
âœ… **Dark Mode UI**: A sleek, modern dark theme for a better user experience.  

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries Used**:  
  - `pandas`, `numpy` for data processing  
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning  
  - `streamlit` for UI  

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Information  
The dataset used is **Movies Dataset.csv**, which includes:  
- `Name`: Movie title
